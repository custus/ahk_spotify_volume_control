# ahk_spotify_volume_control

A script for https://autohotkey.com/

Use the Media Volume Keys to set the Volume for Spotify.

Just install AHK und run the script. 
You need to compile it and run it as administrator to make it work correctly.
Small Bug it wont work correctly when Spotify is the focused window.
